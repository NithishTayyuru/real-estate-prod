Project Overview:
Developed and maintained a comprehensive Real Estate Management system. Key features include efficient management of property listings, tenant applications, lease agreements, and user roles for both property managers and tenants. The application uses AWS Cognito for user authentication and authorization.
Responsibilities:
System Design & Implementation: Designed the system architecture for a full-stack real estate platform, implementing core functionalities for property, tenant, and manager interactions.
Database Management: Created and managed the database schema using Prisma, defining models for properties, users (tenants and managers), applications, leases, and payments. Utilized a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS, with PostGIS for handling geospatial data related to property locations.
API Development: Built a RESTful API with Node.js and Express to handle data flow between the client and server. Implemented JWT-based authentication to secure the API endpoints.
Frontend Development: Developed a user-friendly and responsive user interface with Next.js and React.
Tools & Technologies:
Frontend: Next.js, React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, AWS Amplify UI
Backend: Node.js, Express, Prisma, TypeScript
Database: PostgreSQL (on AWS), PostGIS

Cloud Services: AWS S3 for file storage
Accomplishments:
Successfully developed a user-friendly, full-stack real estate management system with secure user authentication.
Implemented a robust system for managing property listings, tenant applications, and lease agreements.
Created a scalable and maintainable codebase using modern technologies and best practices, all hosted within the AWS ecosystem.
